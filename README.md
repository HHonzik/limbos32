**DO NOT LEAVE ME YOUTUBE COMMENTS ASKING ME HOW TO INSTALL THIS GAME**

## Install guide

1) install python from [python.org](https://python.org/downloads) and use the settings from these images:

2) once you have that installed, download the source code of this repository (project) by clicking on the green `<> code` button and clicking "download ZIP" (if you have git installed git clone it with the url provided down below that)
3) unzip the .zip (7-zip for extraction is recommended but you can use anything which can extract it)
4) navigate to the unzipped folder with the source code
5) open the file start.bat which should finish the rest automatically
6) You might want or need to change the config, for that rename sample_config(.json) to config(.json) and do your changes (like changing the python3 to python for some reason)

### Need tech support?


if you are struggling to install this or have issues running this, make a github issue and someone who knows what they are doing may help you. this may or may not be me (probably not me, i don't have that much free time). if you know what you are doing and want to help others, then please answer people's questions in the github issues and i will try to mark them as resolved.

### Want to help out?
If you want to help out, the only way is to contribute to the code (like by fixing bugs, making transparency work better, etc..) which is made in **Py**thon and one **Bat**ch script for starting this.
